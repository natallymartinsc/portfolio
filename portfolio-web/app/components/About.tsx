            Hi, I am NÃ¡tally! I am a biomedical informatics student at the
            Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre, with a
            passion for combining technology and healthcare. Currently, I am a
            software engineering intern, working to deepen my skills in backend
            and frontend development, particularly using .NET, C#, and Angular.
            Beyond programming, I am fascinated by bioinformatics and
            computational biology, exploring protein structure prediction and
            phylogenetics. I am also working on personal projects like app
            development and building my programming portfolio. In my free time,
            I enjoy learning new things, practicing crochet, and listening to
            podcasts. 
            <br />
            Over the years, I have been involved in interdisciplinary
            projects that merge biology and technology, looking for innovative
            solutions to problems that can achieve better outcomes through
            technology. I am excited to see where my passion for science and
            computing will take me in the future, and I am determined to embrace
            new challenges and keep evolving in the tech field.
